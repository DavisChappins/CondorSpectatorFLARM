# CondorSpectatorFLARM
Condor spectator mode receives positions of all gliders in a race.  
Send these positions to XCSoar to see Condor traffic on XCSoar.  
This requires condor spectator to be run on a second copy of Condor and on a second computer.
Also requires the XCSoar install to run and use CondorFLARM.fln as the FLARM file to decode competition numbers.
