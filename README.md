# CondorSpectatorFLARM
Condor spectator mode receives positions of all gliders in a race.  
Send these positions to XCSoar to see Condor traffic on XCSoar.  
After condor version 3.03 a local file is generated so this can be run on your computer without needing a second dedicated specator pc

Since the PFLAA sentance (traffic) is relative to YOU - the script needs to know who YOU are - You'll need to change the CN in line 214 from DC1 to whatever you are.

Also requires the XCSoar install to run and use CondorFLARM.fln as the FLARM file to decode competition numbers.
